# Liam Quinn | Porfolio

I’m a full-stack software engineer with strong experience integrating AI into applications. I owe my success in my self-taught education to my innate curiosity and determination. My History background demonstrates my love for discussing abstract ideas, and my ability to use divergent thinking to solve problems. I’m an effective independent worker, but thrive most when working collaboratively because I’m an excellent speaker and listener. I navigate conflict effectively since I consider diverse opinions. Management experience in hospitality has shown my industriousness and competence when making critical decisions under time pressure. I have a passion for software and I want to challenge myself in this industry.
